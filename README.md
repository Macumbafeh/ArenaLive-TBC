TODO:
- implement standalone DR tracker for each frame
- implement healindicator
- implement absorb indicator
- implement castbar shield for situations in which a cast is not interruptable
- turn off BuffLib in PvE situations
- cooler looking textures from the retail version


Milestones:
- build raidframes
- build arena frames which will replace Gladdy/Proximo etc entirely (including buffs and such)
- take over "/target arena1" functionality from Gladdy/ArenaFrames
- find some way which sets BuffLib/TrinketTracker as required addons and still maintain all functionality
- localization
